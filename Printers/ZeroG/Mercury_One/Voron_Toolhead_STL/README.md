# STL files for Klicky probe on a Zero G Mercury One with Voron Toolhead

Here you can find the parts that are specific to the Zero G Mercury One when using a Voron Toolhead (Afterburner / Stealthburner).

There is no need for supports, all the files are ready to print, they are in the recommended orientation.

The Klicky Probe consists on four different components:
- Toolhead mount, found on the [AB/SB STL directory](../../../Voron/v1.8_v2.4_Legacy_Trident/v1.8_v2.4_Legacy_Trident_STL) [KlickyProbe_AB_mount_v2](../../../Voron/v1.8_v2.4_Legacy_Trident/v1.8_v2.4_Legacy_Trident_STLKlickyProbe_AB_mount_v2) 
- the probe itself, found on the [KlickyProbe STL directory](../../../../Probes/KlickyProbes/STL) [KlickyProbe_v2](../../../../Probes/KlickyProbes/STL/KlickyProbe_v2.stl) 
- probe dock, found on the [base STL directory](../../../../Probes/KlickyProbes/STL) [Probe_Dock_v2](../../../../Probes/KlickyProbes/STL/Probe_Dock_v2.stl) 
- Frame dock mount, found in this directory.

The recommended printing configuration are:

* initial layer height: 0.24
* layer height: 0.2mm
* bottom/top/perimeters: 4
* infill: more than 23%
* infill type: Cubic
* Thin walls: On
